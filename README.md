## What It Can Do

* **Detect Your Current Location**
  As soon as you open the app, it detects your location and sets it as your starting point.

* **Search for Places**
  Type the name of a location — your current location is automatically set as the source, and you can choose any destination.

* **Show Routes**
  Draws a clear route from your current location to the destination so you can follow it easily.

* **Add Markers**
  Marks your current location and destination on the map so you always know where you are.

* **Real-Time Location Updates**
  Continuously updates your location on the map as you move.
